Fence wraps commands in a sandbox that blocks network access by default and restricts filesystem operations based on configurable rules. It's most useful for running semi-trusted code (package installs, build scripts, CI jobs, unfamiliar repos) with controlled side effects, and it can also complement AI coding agents as defense-in-depth.

```bash
# Block all network access (default)
fence curl https://example.com  # → 403 Forbidden

# Allow specific domains
fence -t code npm install  # → uses 'code' template with npm/pypi/etc allowed

# Block dangerous commands
fence -c "rm -rf /"  # → blocked by command deny rules
```

Fence is also a permission manager for your CLI agents. **Works with popular coding agents like Claude Code, Codex, Amp, Gemini CLI, GitHub Copilot, OpenCode, Factory (Droid) CLI, and many more** - see [agents.md](./docs/agents.md).

## Install

**macOS / Linux:**

```bash
curl -fsSL https://cli.fencesandbox.com/install.sh | sh
```

**Homebrew (macOS):**

```bash
brew tap use-tusk/tap
brew install use-tusk/tap/fence
```

**Nix (macOS, Linux, Windows (WSL)):**

```sh
nix run nixpkgs#fence -- --help
```

This runs it directly from the repository, without installing `fence`. If you want to install it, follow the guidelines [from NixOS](https://nix.dev) or [nix-darwin](https://github.com/nix-darwin/nix-darwin).

<details>
<summary>Other installation methods</summary>

**Go install:**

```bash
go install github.com/Use-Tusk/fence/cmd/fence@latest
```

**Build from source:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Use-Tusk/fence
cd fence
go build -o fence ./cmd/fence
```

</details>

**Additional requirements for Linux:**

- `bubblewrap` (for sandboxing)
- `socat` (for network bridging)
- `bpftrace` (optional, for filesystem violation visibility when monitoring with `-m`)

## Usage

### Basic

```bash
# Run command with all network blocked (no domains allowed by default)
fence curl https://example.com

# Run with shell expansion
fence -c "echo hello && ls"

# Enable debug logging
fence -d curl https://example.com

# Use a template
fence -t code -- claude  # Runs Claude Code using `code` template config

# Monitor mode (shows violations)
fence -m npm install

# Send Fence's own monitor/debug logs to a file
fence -m --fence-log-file /tmp/fence.log -- claude
tail -f /tmp/fence.log

# Inspect the config inheritance chain and active merged config
fence config show

# Show all commands and options
fence --help
```

> [!TIP]
> Need to pass flags to the command you are running? Use `--` to separate Fence flags from command flags, for example:
>
> ```bash
> fence -- claude --dangerously-skip-permissions
> ```

### Configuration

When `--settings` is not provided, Fence first looks for `fence.jsonc` (or `fence.json`) in the current directory and parent directories. If none is found, it falls back to `~/.config/fence/fence.{jsonc,json}`. Both extensions are treated as JSONC (comments and trailing commas are allowed). See [configuration reference](./docs/configuration.md) for more details.

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Use-Tusk/fence/main/docs/schema/fence.schema.json",
  "extends": "code",
  "network": { "allowedDomains": ["private.company.com"] },
  "filesystem": { "allowWrite": ["."] },
  "command": { "deny": ["git push", "npm publish"] }
}
```

For repo-local overrides on top of each user's normal Fence config, use:

```json
{
  "extends": "@base",
  "filesystem": { "allowWrite": ["."] }
}
```

Use `fence --settings ./custom.json` to specify a different config.

Inspect the active config without running a command:

```bash
fence config show
fence config show --settings ./custom.json
fence config show --template code
```

`fence config show` prints the config chain to `stderr` and the fully resolved config as plain JSON to `stdout`, so you can pipe the JSON to tools like `jq`.

Create a starter config with sensible defaults:

```bash
# Creates config at the default path with:
# { "extends": "code" }
fence config init

# Include scaffold arrays as editable hints
fence config init --scaffold
```

### Import from Claude Code

```bash
fence import --claude --save
```

## Features

- **Network isolation** - All outbound blocked by default; allowlist domains via config
- **Filesystem restrictions** - Control read/write access paths
- **Command blocking** - Deny dangerous commands like `rm -rf /`, `git push`
- **SSH Command Filtering** - Control which hosts and commands are allowed over SSH
- **Built-in templates** - Pre-configured rulesets for common workflows
- **Violation monitoring** - Real-time logging of blocked requests (`-m`)
- **Cross-platform** - macOS (sandbox-exec) + Linux (bubblewrap)

Fence can be used as a Go package or CLI tool.
